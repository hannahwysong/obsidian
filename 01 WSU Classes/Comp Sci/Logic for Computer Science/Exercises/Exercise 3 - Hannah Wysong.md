###### Exercise 17 For the program P in Example 1.2.18, compute the following.  
a) T P ({p(c), q(c, c)})  
b) T P (BP )  
###### Exercise 18 With respect to Example 1.2.18, verify that BP is a pre-fixed point of TP .  
###### Exercise 19 Give three pre-fixed points and one fixed point of the T P -operator for P as in Exercise 16.  
###### Exercise 20 Compute T P ↑ n for all n ∈ N and T P ↑ ω for P as in Example 1.2.7.  
###### Exercise 21 Compute T P ↑ n for all n ∈ N and T P ↑ ω for P as in Exercise 15.  
###### Exercise 22 Compute T P ↑ n for all n ∈ N and T P ↑ ω as in Exercise 11.  
###### Exercise 23 Compute T P ↑ n for all n ∈ N and T P ↑ ω as in Example 1.2.19.  
###### Exercise 24 T P ↑ n for all n ∈ N and T P ↑ ω for P as in Example 1.2.8.  
###### Exercise 25 Show that the Datalog program from Example 1.1.1 Herbrand-entails grandmotherOf(ann, malia).  
###### Exercise 26 (no hand-in – if coding helps you with the material) Write a computer program (you may choose your favorite language), which accepts as input graphs specified in the form of Example  1.1.5, and computes all T P ↑ n, where P consists of all the non-fact Datalog rules from Example 1.1.5, plus the input graph encoded as facts.  

###### Exercise 27 (no hand-in – give it a try if you’re math-minded) Given a Datalog program P, an interpretation I ⊆ BP is said to be supported if for every A ∈ I there exists a rule B1∧· · ·∧Bn → A in ground(P ) with {B1, . . . , Bn} ⊆ I. Show the following.  
a) An interpretation I ∈ IP is supported if and only if I ⊆ T P (I).  
b) The least Herbrand model of any program is supported.
