Questions for Project: 
1.  Should we reach out to CATS for the WSU course catalog data or is there another way to access it? 
2. Should students be able to make changes to the schedule after approved by faculty? 
3. Does this only apply to full time students or should there be an option to take below 12 credit hours?
4. Should Co-ops replace a class in the time slot? If not, how would adding one affect the over all schedule? 
5. Does this need to be in the format of a schedule builder or can it return like an excel file with all of the required classes in order? 
6. Should this include every major and minor available at Wright state or can we pick a certain college and use only those majors and minors? 
7. Do we have to consider the majors that cant have certain minors?
8. 

(bonus) Will you add due dates to pilot? Also what do you recommend to use for the frontend/backend?

My thoughts: 
- if we can make the website an  angular application it would be easy to push updates using docker and git actions
