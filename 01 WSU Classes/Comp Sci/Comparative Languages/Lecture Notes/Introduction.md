- Racket – functional programming language
- Ruby – very object oriented, interpreted
- Python – object oriented, interpreted
- A low-level language would be something like Assembly, where you are directly thinking about what the hardware is doing.
- A mid-level language would be something like C, where you think about what the hardware is doing some of the time, but also have facilities that do a lot of that stuff for you.
- A high-level language would be something like Python which allows you to code while handling all the details of how the machine performs them for you.
- Machine Code – the lowest level language
	- Consist of an opcode word followed by extension words
	- Directly operates on the gates/hardware of the CPU
- Assembly – instructions directly control the registers gates and devices in the CPU
- An assembly line corresponds to one machine code instruction
- Assembly is fast and efficient, but it is hard to understand and requires different programs for different hardware
- Compiled Languages are ascii text that is compiled into machine code
- A compiler takes the code to turn it into an executable to create output
- An interpreter takes the program and the input and creates the output
- Scheme is the mother of modern function languages like haskell
	- Racket is a simplification of scheme, and both are functional programming languages
-   Object oriented programming is all about separating repeating items into classes
