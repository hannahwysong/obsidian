prev notes - [[Introduction]]

- Compiling high level languages: 
	- source code > compiler > assembly (txt) > assembler > relocatable object code (machine code without address) > linker/ loader > executable code
- Interpreted languages are not compiled 
	- source code is ran directly or compiled into a more efficient pseudo language 
- only machine code can be ran on the CPU 
- an interpreter is an executable program which runs the appropriate machine code 
- Interpreting languages 
	- Program + input > interpreter > output 
- Compiling is much faster and can be easily to ported to other hardware 
- Compiling can be used for 
	- web programming
	- logic programming 
- Racket is used to write recursive functions because there are not iterative constructs
- Interpreted languages can be built and executed on the file 
	- essentially the "compiler" is built into the interpreter program
- Pros of Interpreted Languages 
	- fast, untyped variables
- Cons of Interpreted languages
	- much slower, harder to debug, not appropriate for large scale development
- Natural languages - languages people speak
	- have grammar and semantics 
	- semantics: has one meaning but means another
- Formal languages - languages designed for specific applications
- Anatomy of a compiler: 
	- lexical analyzer (program)> syntax analyzer (token stream)> intermediate code generator(parse tree) > intermediate code optimizer(intermediate interpretation) > code generation 
- Tokens are everything but whitespaces and comments 
- [context free grammar(CFG)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/theory-of-computation/what-is-context-free-grammar/) is a 4-tuple G = (V, Σ, R, S)
	- V = variables, non-terminal symbols
	- Σ = terminal symbols (alphabet)
	- R = production rules 
	- S = start symbol 
		- they are all finite 
- set of strings generated by the set are called the language of the grammar
- lambda is an empty string so it means nothing 
- parse tree - derivation of an expression can be expressed as a tree 
- two or more parse trees mean a grammar is ambiguous
