Select all of the following statements that are cogent critiques of the following requirement:
"_4.A.5 The database shall support the generation and control of configuration objects; that is, objects which are themselves groupings of other objects in the database. The configuration control facilities shall allow access to the objects in a version group by the use of an incomplete name._"
- The quoted requirement is actually two separate requirements that should be numbered separately.
- The word "_support"_ is ambiguous in the quoted requirement. Would a "help page" identifying courses about database administration constitute "support?"
- The terms, "_incomplete name", "allow access", and "version group",_ may not be adequately defined in the quoted text unless separate references to the definitions are provided.

	- _But not limited to_
	- _Etc
	- _And/or_
