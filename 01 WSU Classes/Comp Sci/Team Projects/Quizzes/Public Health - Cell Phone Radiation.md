###### Relevant facts are accurate statements that contribute to our current understanding of the topic at hand, the specific problem, and potential solutions.  What are the relevant facts of this contemporary issue?
- Rats exposed to a lifetime of electromagnetic radiation developed rare cancers in their hearts and brains
- There is inconsistent data on the effects of cell phone radiation in humans, and current safety guidelines are based on short-term thermal effects
- Recent advances in wireless technology (e.g., new modulation schemes) do not seem to lessen the risk posed by cell phone radiation
- More than 90 percent of American adults use cell phones
###### Competing interests represent the views that may be in conflict with one another, contribute to the persistence of an issue, obscure potential solutions, and make this an ethical dilemma. What are the competing interests with respect to the topic of this quiz?
- Public health professionals are concerned about long-term health risks to cell phone users, but conclusive data on these risks is missing.
- If new safety standards are imposed, cell phone manufacturers are concerned about the increased cost of complying with those standards.
- The FCC may need to modify current policies for wireless devices, thus increasing costs for manufacturers or reducing performance for users
- Cell phone manufacturers are concerned that changes in recommended safe use may affect user demand for cell phones, if the devices are widely perceived to be less safe
###### Affected parties are those people or organizations that are directly or indirectly impacted by the issue at hand, that are impacted by potential solutions, or that may contribute to resolutions.  Who/what are the effected parties?
- Cell Phone Makers
-  Federal regulatory bodies
- cell phone users
###### Potential solutions should be feasible options for the future that present some opportunity for resolving the competing interests surrounding the issue at hand, perhaps at the expense of one effected part or another.  What potential solutions, including technical and nontechnical approaches, are relevant to the problem discussed?
- Investigate different signal modulation types that may affect the type of RF exposure from wireless devices
- As the cell phone industry group CTIA-The Wireless Association maintains that there are no established health effects from cell phone radiation, more in-depth studies should be conducted to quantify any health risks
- The FCC can follow recommendations from health experts in modifying policies and regulations regarding wireless devices
- Develop and promote devices to permit cell phone use with the device separated from the body, for example headsets and Bluetooth ear buds and microphones
