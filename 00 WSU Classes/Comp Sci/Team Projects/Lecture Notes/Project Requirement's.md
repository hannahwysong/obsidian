Planning and Management 
- understand what needs to be done and what is willing to be done 
- requirements set stage for failure 
Example: 
- should store at least 32 Giga-bytes of non-volatile data
- operates with class iii power supply in accordance with safety standard IEC60950-1
	- tend to be short systems describing system hardware or capability 
- Technical language and consumer language is different 
Development Process Choices
- Prototyping /agile: rebuilding system based on customer response 
- Waterfall: requirements > design > development > integration & test > deployment & maintenance 
	- we will be using this process for our project 
	- controversial because the process takes time with little response 
	- better used for requirements while agile is better for deployment
Requirements 
- statement that identifies the capability of a system for it to have value and utility to a customer 
- is necessary, verifiable, and attainable
- defines WHAT will be built not HOW 
- often legally binding

| Types Of Requirements |                    |            |                |           |
| --------------------- | ------------------ | ---------- | -------------- | --------- |
| Functional            | Legal / Regulatory | Safety     | Transportation | Interface |
| Performance           | Quality of Service | Deployment | Security       | Physical  |
| Design Capabilites    | Enviroment         | Privacy    | Training       |           |
Requirement Specification 
	should be stated:
	- without ambiguity
	- complete
	- consistent 
	- traceable
	- without design details 
	- unitary
Wording 
- requirements use shall or must
- statements use will 
- goals use should - not legally binding 
Requirements vs Constraint 
- constraint: limits design alternatives 
- requirements: defines what shareholders desire
